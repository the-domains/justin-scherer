## The challenge: 

I worked as the lead UX Designer on this project. 

We had to create a unified web presence from scratch for the biggest integrated marketing agency in Canada. 

The site had to represent the best work and capabilities of dozens of divisions, which were all centrally managed but independently operated and located all over the country in three regional offices. Also, it had to be responsive. No big deal, right?

## Approach: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a4f3b28-620f-4a22-9744-fe6dd917df3b.gif)

Getting buy in from so many people meant that the design work we did had to be constantly visible and open for critique at any time. We used big foam core boards and the walls of the office to post up sketches, competitive audits, and paste-up comps and creative concepts. The project war room was a revolving door of stakeholders. Anyone, from a junior art director to the CEO could walk in at any moment. 

We started by  spending a LOT of time looking at the portfolio sites of digital agencies from all over the world. Then we worked through as many concepts at low fidelity as possible---sketching, wireframing, and getting quick feedback from devs and art direction.

## Solution:

Make the creative so attention grabbing and massive that casual browsers' first instinct is to ignore the chrome of the site. They get pulled in. but have the navigation be succinct and intuitive enough, so that, if someone is looking for something specific, they'll be able to find it. 

Have a second-level of navigation based on location that works for the Vancouver and Calgary offices for specific pitches, they're specific clients. Create a carefully-curated laundry list of agency capabilities.

a circular, inclusive brand identity refresh on an agency that's almost a hundred years old

Campaign-specific case studies where the quality of creative work and results get emphasized
