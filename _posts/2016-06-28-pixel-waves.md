  Pixel Waves is a series of three continuously looping, procedural animations
  using Processing and HYPE Framework. The animations explore the push and pull
  of tides using grids of monochromatic dots that oscillate between randomized
  limits. Taken individually, each cell in an animation repeats a series of
  simple transformations. Together, unexpected patterns emerge, morph, and give
  the cells complexity and meaning as a larger collective.

# Pixel Waves

Pixel Waves is a series of three continuously looping, procedural animations using [Processing][0] and [HYPE Framework.][1] The animations explore the push and pull of tides using grids of monochromatic dots that oscillate between randomized limits. Taken individually, each cell in an animation repeats a series of simple transformations. Together, unexpected patterns emerge, morph, and give the cells complexity and meaning as a larger collective. 

Pixel Waves was chosen for the exhibition _Earth, Sea, and Sky_ at the OCAD U Continuing Studies Gallery in Toronto. The show runs from July 7th till September 8th 2016\. __
