# About Justin

I'm a designer in Toronto. 

## Human experiences of the digital world, or, what I'm about

Technology is best when its human. In my work, I'm usually trying to push that one of two ways:

* Technology: a seamless aide for your every whim that works exactly the way you expect without getting in your way or making you think too hard

OR

* Technology: an instrument of cosmic awe and perception melting empowerment 

## THE LIST, i.e. A (by no means exhaustive) directory of things I gladly do for money:

Any flavour of what people usually call "user experience design", including, but not limited to:

* interaction design 
* user interface design
* information architecture
* user experience strategy
* user experience research
* rapid prototyping
* etc. etc. etc.

Workshop facilitation

Creative consulting, i.e. giving you, the client, big, holistic ideas

Generative art and design, i.e. writing code to build things so I don't have to

Creative technology, i.e. making wacky, digital things with Processing and/or Arduino

Branding

Art Direction

Speaking

Teaching

Writing

Research

Some of my past clients include: Scotiabank, MasterCard, RBC Royal Bank, GM Canada, WIND Mobile, Chevrolet, MSN, UEFA, and theScore Mobile.

I'm always looking for new collaborations, projects, side hustles, etc. If you've got a neat idea, reach out through the digital ether and let me know about it.

If you're in Toronto, we should probably grab a coffee.
