# Case Study: Territory Circulations no. 1: You had me at hello world

_Territory Circulations wa_s a [telematic][0] performance in Montreal and Palo Alto as a part of the concert _Telematic Embrace_. I co-created the piece with [Michael Palumbo][1]. I used [Processing][2] to create an animated, Twitter-powered "digital conductor" that connected the artists in Montreal and Palo Alto with audiences both in the auditorium and following live streams worldwide.

The concept worked with the circulations of information, energy, bodies across massive territories, collapsed and mediated by technology. Our goal was to create a loop. The audience could control an animated conductor through Twitter, which would influence the performers, who would play to the audience, who would then react via Twitter to influence the musicians, and so on and so on. 

## Process

Michael and I collaborated on this piece remotely, mostly via Skype, he in Montreal, and I in Toronto. 

I sketched a bunch and started coming up with these abstract forms that resembled lungs or rib cages or topographical drawings of islands or beating hearts.  I left the lines uneven and sketchy to emphasize the improvisational nature of the performance and gave them a bright, shouty colour palette to make it feel like social media is shouting at the performers, which it was.
