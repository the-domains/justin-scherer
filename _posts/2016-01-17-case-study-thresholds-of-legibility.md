# Case Study: Thresholds of Legibility

_Thresholds of Legibility_ was a practice-based research project in the form of a digitally mediated surveillance theatre performance at the Luella Massey Studio Theatre in Toronto. It was funded by the _Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada_. I co-created the piece with 6 other collaborators and designed a dispersed, Arduino-controlled sensor network for the project.

From the outset, the project was extremely ambitious. A group of 7 collaborators who had never worked together before were to co-create a digitally mediated surveillance performance in only a few weeks. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/75b6fa755ec47220f130a1a3c741b863d1355866.jpg)

According to the project's director:

> The intent of this collaboration was to use the skills of performers and the craft of theatre to explore poorly understood aspects of life within the modern surveillance apparatus.

## The Process

Our director, David J. Phillips, put together a multidisciplinary team of performers, dancers, researchers, designers and projectionists, and we worked together in the performance space over an intense, three week period to build a piece.

I was way out of my comfort zone on this project. I was told to show up to rehearsal in "movement clothes" and we spent a good portion of the project's early days "playing" theatre games, as well as doing vocal and physical exercises. I added my own collaborative design methods to the mix (cognitive mapping, rapid prototyping, etc.). The blended methodology made it possible for collaborators with disparate backgrounds to work and play through a complex conceptual landscape and come to consensus on a final performance.

## The Performance

The theatre space was divided into different zones with sensor checkpoints at the entry and exit. Each zone contained its own micro-performance, each wildly different from the others, and the audience checked in and out of the zones as they moved through the performance. We wanted to use real-time data collection about the bodies of performers and participants and statistical cluster analysis to find outliers and single them out in a final "spectacle." The vagaries of live performance and the extremely short project lifespan meant that we had to "wizard of Oz" a lot of the statistical analysis in the end. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4351858b4879d9eeade4641e3c7b7948d2409187.png)
